# Boilp Templates

Create multiple pages application on the fly

## What we do?

To create a page, just edit the `pages.js` file with the syntax

```shell
module.exports = createPagesPrototype([
    {
        title: 'The category name',
        base: 'category-in-slug',
        pages: [
            {
                title: 'Title of a single page'
            },
        ]
    },
]);
```

It will automatically create for you 2 separate files in `app/pages/slug/` and `views/pages/slug/`

## Examples

Depends on your work. I create this templates to control my learning journey at the beginning (because I have to create each file for each lesson ðŸ˜’), so I just wanna control all in one place

I have 2 examples below:

- [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey-ruddy.vercel.app/) - my learning journey in Three.js, control all lessons in one place :)
- [Creative Corners](https://creative-coding-delta.vercel.app/) - my creative corners, I can do all the creative things in my mind in one place :)

## Deployment

Run `./public` in dev mode

```shell
npm start
```

Build files from `./app` to `./public` for production and run in production mode

```shell
npm run build
```
